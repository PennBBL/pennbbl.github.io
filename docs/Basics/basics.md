# Background



The following sections describe the initial actions that are needed before the more useful tutorials in other sections can be run. Each tutorial lists the prerequisites.



# Installing python



Estimated time: 15 minutes



First, get a package management system. Recommended is miniconda (conda): **Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies.**



https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.



You can check if you have this successfully by going to the terminal and doing:

```

$ which conda

```



You may need to log out and log back in before you're able to access the `conda` command.



## Start a virtual environment



Use miniconda to create a virtual environment, a restricted workspace where your programs and processes can operate without affecting everything on your computer. Create an environment called flywheel (or something else unique and memorable), in the terminal:

```

$ conda create -n flywheel anaconda python=3

```

At the prompt for which packages to install, type y and hit enter. Itâ€™s better to have them all, and they will not take up a lot of space on your machine:

```

:

$ wurlitzer          pkgs/main/osx-64::wurlitzer-1.0.2-py37_0

$ xlrd               pkgs/main/osx-64::xlrd-1.2.0-py37_0

$ xlsxwriter         pkgs/main/noarch::xlsxwriter-1.1.8-py_0

$ xlwings            pkgs/main/osx-64::xlwings-0.15.8-py37_0

$ xlwt               pkgs/main/osx-64::xlwt-1.3.0-py37_0

$ xz                 pkgs/main/osx-64::xz-5.2.4-h1de35cc_4

$ yaml               pkgs/main/osx-64::yaml-0.1.7-hc338f04_2

$ zeromq             pkgs/main/osx-64::zeromq-4.3.1-h0a44026_3

$ zict               pkgs/main/noarch::zict-1.0.0-py_0

$ zipp               pkgs/main/noarch::zipp-0.5.1-py_0

$ zlib               pkgs/main/osx-64::zlib-1.2.11-h1de35cc_3

$ zstd               pkgs/main/osx-64::zstd-1.3.7-h5bba6e5_0





$ Proceed ([y]/n)?

```



Activate your environment, so that any packages you install or use stay restricted to this project:



```

$ conda activate <your_environment_name>

```



If you ran the `conda create` command above, you would replace `<your_environment_name>` with `flywheel`.



You can make lots of conda environments. It makes sense to have a single environment for Flywheel, but you may want to make separate environments if you're using Python for analysis.



## Install Jupyter



Many of the tutorials here will display Python commands as if they were being entered in an interactive python session (i.e. with a leading `>>>` or `...` if the line is a continuation). If you install `jupyter`, you can paste these directly into a jupyter console session.



```bash

$ conda install jupyter

$ jupyter console

Jupyter console 6.0.0



Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 29 2018, 00:00:04)

Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information

IPython 7.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.







In [1]:  



```



You can now directly paste the Python code (`>>>` included) into the console and it will be run correctly.





## Installing an editor



Writing easily-readable code is very important. A good editor will help you check your code's syntax and can provide hints as you write. One great way to get started is to use the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor. A version should be available for your operating system.



Atom lets you install packages that add functionality to the editor. If you go to `Preferences > Packages`, you can search for and install a package called `ide-python` that will help with python development.

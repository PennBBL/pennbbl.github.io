# Getting data from Flywheel


## Accessing data in Python

### Data container information

### File attachments

## Downloading specific files

## Downloading BIDS

### Using the CLI

We don't recommend using this approach, but it is possible to use the Flywheel CLI
to download BIDS directly without using Python. See their documentation for
[usage](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008224093-Command-Line-Interface-Overview).

### Using `fw-heudiconv-export`

## Downloading analysis results

### Accessing zip members

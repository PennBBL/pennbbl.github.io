All Penn LINC members are encouraged to document their software and analyses, in the form of code, prose, tutorials, or a mix of all 3. In this documentation about documentation, we're going to outline how you can start writing documentation for your work and contribute to this site.



# Getting Started



You will need a [Github account](https://github.com) to be able to contribute; this website is automatically generated by a code repository on Github and is written primarily in markdown, so that's where we're going to keep our focus on this task. There is *no requirement* that you have prior knowledge about how to code, and the first part of this tutorial will focus on contributing via the Github web interface (so you have nothing to download).



## Scenario 1: Starting New Documentation



As a prerequisite to starting new documentation, you should have an idea of where this tutorial may fit in the context of the site. `just-the-docs`' structure allows us to create nested directories (folders) so we can organize our thoughts and documents efficiently. If this documentation fits under another topic, please create a new file in the appropriate folder. Otherwise, create a new folder for the topic.



All folders should fall under `pennbbl.github.io/docs/`, and often a single markdown file is enough for some documentation — it would be the 'homepage' of that topic.



For example, if I had a tutorial for my analysis pipeline named `foo`, I would create a topic directory and a markdown file (with the extension `.md`) in that directory to write the documentation:



`pennbbl.github.io/docs/foo/foo_processing.md`



In this case, you can create a new file right from the Github:

*Note: you don't have to explicitly create folders in the Github web interface; just type out your filename and path with backslashes and Github will automatically create the directory structure for you.*



## Scenario 2: Contributing to Existing Documentation



If, on the other hand, you are contributing to existing documentation, then the process is simpler. All you will need to do is navigate to the file on Github, and click the edit button to begin editing:

# Formatting



Markdown is a great language to write documentation in. It is flexible, yet explicit, and easy to pick up. See [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more on markdown.



Importantly, you must also include a YAML header in all of your markdown files. YAML (YetAnotherMarkdownLanguage) is a language used to create headers in markdown files, and these headers provide specific instructions to other programs on *how* to render a markdown document. YAML headers are begun right at the top of the document and are fenced in by 3 hyphens. Anything within a YAML header is of the form `key: value`, and the keys can describe a number of things. For example, this document's YAML header is:



```

layout: redirect

redirect: https://PennLINC.github.io/docs/Contributing/documentation_guidelines/

title: Writing Your Own Docs

parent: Contributing

has_toc: true

nav_order: 1

---

```

The `layout` and `title` are self explanatory. `parent` describes the fact that this page is a child page of the Contributing document, and `has_toc` tells the renderer that this page should have a table of contents. For more on the available YAML header options for this site, see [this page](/docs/just-the-docs_documentation/navigation-structure/).



# Committing Your Changes



Once your edits are complete, you will need to commit them to the repository. This basically means you are happy with the changes you've made to the code, and you want to take a snapshot of it in this state; additionally, committing code to this repository is the mechanism that causes new data to render automatically to the website. While you write in markdown, you can also preview the format of the changes in Github's web page using the "preview" button (see below).



We recommend, if you are unfamiliar with how this works under the hood, that you always commit your changes to a new branch (i.e. a separate version) so that someone can review and test your changes in a Pull Request (a code proposition, if you will). You can change and describe the branch you're committing to at the bottom of the page:



<img src="/assets/images/committing-changes.png" alt="">



On the next page you can explicitly ask for someone to review the changes to your code before they are *merged* into the main codebase, after which, the changes are rendered.



<img src="/assets/images/request-reviewer.png" alt="">



When you are ready, hit "Submit" and your code will be reviewed and merged into the code base. Once this is done, your new documentation will show up automatically on the website in a matter of minutes!



# Merge Conflicts & Syncing



Sometimes, when you've been working on contributing code, you may find that someone else has been working on the same file. This creates a merge conflict when you try to put your changes together. To solve this, it may be necessary to get your files back on track with whatever has happened while you were editing — this is called *syncing your fork*, and is basically everything we discussed above but in reverse. The steps are as follows (we will use the terms "you" to denote your forked repository, and "them" to denote the repository you forked from):



1. Use the Github *compare* tool to compare your repository against the one you forked; initially, it will have theirs as the *base repository* on the left, and your fork as the *head repository* on the right. This means a pull request will ask to merge *head into base*... We want to accomplish the opposite!



2. Switch the base repository to your fork; you'll now get a message that says you have no changes to compare (it is you comparing with you, after all).



3. Click on "compare against forks" at the top, and change the head (on the right) to *their* repository.



4. Now you can see the commits that *they* made since you forked and started working, if any; from this page, start a pull request, which is essentially you, *asking you*, if you want their commits added to your fork.



You can see this process explained in further detail [here](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381).



# For Professionals



This section describes how to accomplish the above using `jekyll` at the command line. (Coming Soon).

## Getting started

This site documents knowledge and practices in informatics, engineering, and systems administration for members of LINC. If you need to know:

- How to get a new Flywheel account
- How to transfer DICOM files from place to place
- How to use `QSIPrep` or `XCPEngine`
- How to set python environment management
- Who to turn to for additional help

This site will help you navigate informatics at LINC.

This effort's success is dependent on your involvement as lab members and a community, so if you have edits to suggest, or documentation requests, please make them known by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/PennBBL/pennbbl.github.io/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/PennBBL/pennbbl.github.io/pulls). If you are a LINC member and are documenting one of your tools/processes, please create your documentation according to the LINC documentation guidelines ([documentation guidelines on how to create documentation coming soon]()) and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/PennBBL/pennbbl.github.io/pulls), so it can be reviewed and added to the site.
